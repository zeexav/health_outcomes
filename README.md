# Health Outcomes and Health Insurance Coverage

Question: Did the increase in Health Insurance Coverage through the Affordable Care Act affect the prevalence of people dying from Chronic Diseases?

Disclaimer: The goal of this project is not to prove that access to Health Insurance is solely responsible for health care outcomes.The goal is to explore whether there is a relationship based on the datasets that were chosen.

### About: 
This project seeks to explore the relationship between deaths by Heart Disease, Stroke and Diabetes and Health Insurance Coverage. These diseases were chosen because according to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/prevent/index.htm) regular screening play a role in preventing Chronic Disease.Therefore if more people have access to health insurance, they would see a doctor regularly or visit a doctor when feeling ill, thereby increasing chances of early detection and possibly helping to decrease the number of deaths by these chronic diseases.
